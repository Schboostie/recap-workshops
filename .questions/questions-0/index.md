Q: What is a javascript REPL? Can you name two ways to open one?

A: {Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is an easy-to-use command-line tool, used for processing Node. js expressions. It captures the user's JavaScript code inputs, interprets, and evaluates the result of this code. It displays the result to the screen, and repeats the process till the user quits the shell.}
